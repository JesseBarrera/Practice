            Hi there! My name's Jesse, and I'm a junior at Harvard, studying philosophy.
            Most of the time, you can catch me sitting on a rock, deep in the process of
            acquiring wisdom. In my free time though, I love to do improv comedy with my troupe,
            Three Letter Acronym (TLA). Improv is a great way to explore your creativity, become
            a more confident public speaker, and have loads of pre-frosh think you're "totes rad
            and gnarly" (I'm not sure why they all speak like that).
        </p>

            This website is intended to be
            an introduction to improv for anyone who's interested in checking it out for the first time.
            On the next few pages, you'll find info about the basic principles of improv, as well as different
            styles of improv!
